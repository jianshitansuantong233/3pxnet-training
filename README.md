# 3PXNet: Pruned-Permuted-Packed XNOR Networks for Edge Machine Learning

This repository enables the reproduction of the experiments described in the article:

[3PXNet: Pruned-Permuted-Packed XNOR Networks for Edge Machine Learning](url)

It is divided in two subrepositories:
* training allows reproduction of training accuracy results reported in the article
* inference allows reproduciton of runtime results reported in the article
